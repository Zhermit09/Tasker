# Description
This is a high school project where one learned how to work with a Google Classroom API. 
The project was written in JavaScript as this was a hand-in for a WebDev course.

During high school for every course we used Google Classroom to hand in our assignments, we also used SchoolSoft which was poorly managed at the time and the calendar was always weird.
I decided that I could do better than whatever they had and made this web app that gives you a proper overview of your upcoming assignments. 

## How to view
Clone the repository and host the `index.html` yourself. Otherwise, the project would usually be hosted by GitHub pages and be accessible [here](https://zhermit09.github.io/Tasker/). 
You need to have a Google Account to authenticate, however sadly even if you did you would most likely not be able to access the application. 
The reason is that one is using Google services for free because the application has not been released and is considered to be under development. 
Because of that, I need to whitelist people to give them access to the application. 

## Preview
![Application preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zhermit09/Tasker/master/images/Tasker.PNG)
Nevertheless here is a preview of the application, on the left you have all your assignments, you can search for them and apply filters. 
You can double-click the assignment to show additional information and a link that leads you to the assignment in the Google Classroom.
On the right is a calendar that shows the current month and highlights the current day per default. 
If at a certain date, you would have a deadline for an assignment it would be seen as a counter in a corner of that day's cell. Clicking the
cell would show you the assignment for that specific day.
